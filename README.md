Compare-inator
==============

This site harnesses some public APIs to attempt to compare trophies/achievements cross-platform for games that are on both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Eventually, I hope for Steam support as well. Currently it's in extreme alpha-phase, having only added the APIs and scraping the data into a local database. Comparing isn't ready nor is registration, though I've seeded some data manually to allow for me to test.
